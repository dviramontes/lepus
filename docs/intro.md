#HELLO FELLOW FORM BUILDERS
---
This is a basic angular generator scaffold.

This generator is a good start for our ~~project~~ journey because it adds a few very **awesome** things, such as
.*editorconfig*, a *grunt*-*workflow*, and much more!

In case you are not terribly familiar with 
yeoman and grunt.js details let me show you around a bit:


	app/
		contains the main angular application
		...

	app/
		bower_components/
			
			Bower installed client side components.	
			Think jquery/zepto, validation tools,
			d3, etc)
	
			You can nstall new with
			$ bower install x-library
			...
		
	
	test/
		our beautiful Karma driven test
		http://karma-runner.github.io/0.10/index.html
		...
