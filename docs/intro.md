#HELLO FELLOW FORM BUILDERS


This is a basic angular generator scaffold.

For starters, you'll want to:

`$ npm install && bower install`

This generator is a good start for our ~~project~~ journey because it adds a few very **awesome** things, such as
.*editorconfig*, a *grunt*-*workflow*, and much more!

In case you are not terribly familiar with 
yeoman and grunt.js details let me show you around a bit:


	app/
		contains the main angular application
		...

	app/
		views/
			These are our templates for 
			our single page app.
			Pretty cool no?
			Remember to update your $routeProvider
			function in app.js in order for angular to
			pick up your new templates.
			...

	app/
		bower_components/
			Bower installed client side components.	
			Think jquery/zepto, validation tools,
			d3, etc)
	
			You can nstall new with
			$ bower install x-library --save 
			...
	
	test/
		our beautiful Karma driven test
		http://karma-runner.github.io/0.10/index.html
		...

	dest/
		static files generated from your app/
		and you can distrubute? 
		...
	
	./Gruntfile.js
		Contains the instructions for
		how to generate all of this goodness*

**More to come...**
